# Hello Vue

Welcome to the Vue.js workshop! In this course we're going to explore all the building blocks of Vue.js--a progressive front end framework with the ability to scale between a lightweight library and full featured framework depending on your application's needs.

## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for novice JavaScript developers. It is perfect for an NSS alum who is interested in learning more about front end development. It assumes you have a background in React as it will occasionally make comparisons along the way to React features. If you liked React during your time at NSS, we think you'll ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š Vue.

It assumes you are familiar with building applications with components, and are comfortable with managing state throughout a component tree. Familiarity with modern JavaScript features will be helpful, but not necessary. If there is an upcoming lecture where we'll use an ES2015 feature we think you might not be familiar with, there will be a video for you to watch beforehand which covers it. That way all our class time can be spent focusing on Vue.

## How is this different from React?

Since React is just meant to be a library, it means that certain things like patterns, best practices, and tooling (i.e. React Router, Redux, etc) are largely left up to the community. As a result you'll find that a React application built by one team is very different than one built by another team.

Vue allows developers the ability to opt in to tools for routing and state management, however they are built and managed by the core Vue team. The Vue community also largely agrees on how Vue apps should be built, and even has an [official style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/). The benefit of this is that a Vue developer should be able to join any new project and start being productive immediately.

If you want a more in depth look at how Vue is different from React, you can read about it on the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html)

## Goals for this course

- Gain an understanding of all parts of a Vue component and building a component tree
- Learn the different ways of managing state in a Vue application
- Learn techniques for modularity and reusability in the Vue ecosystem
- Learn to leverage the Vue router to create Single Page Applications
- Learn how to effectively unit test your applications using the Jest framework and the Vue Testing Utils library
- Conform to Vue best practices as outlined by the Official Style Guide
- Build a portfolio by deploying all applications

## How is this course structured?

Throughout the course, the instructor will live code 4 applications of varying sizes. After each lesson, students may choose to either re-create the well documented steps to rebuild the same application that was done in class, or select a project from the [Project Vault](./project-vault/README.md).

Students may choose to work on Vault projects by themselves or in groups. Each project in the Vault comes with a link to an example application and a list of requirements. Since the class is part-time and face to face time with the instructor is limited, there is also an optional section for most vault projects called `Code By Numbers` -- a high level step-by-step guide for completing the project.

Each app that we build out in class will unlock more applications in the vault for students to work on.

Every project students build will be deployed to Firebase.

Between classes the instructor will occasionally ask you to watch a short video on various JavaScript features that will be used in the next lecture. These videos will typically be only 5-10 minutes long.
