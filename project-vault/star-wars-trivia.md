# Create a Star Wars Trivia flashcard game

For this project, create a set of flashcards which ask the user Star Wars trivia (or some other topic if you'd rather).

[**View a Demo**](https://nss-vue-starwars-trivia.web.app/)

## Part 1

- Create a file somewhere in your project named `trivia.js` and add [these questions](../assets/trivia.js). If you don't want to use Star Wars trivia and would rather do something else, replace these questions with a topic of your choice.
- Using `v-for`, render 25 flash cards with these questions on the screen and the answers hidden.
- Each flash card should have a button or respond to some sort of click which reveals the answer
- Revealing the answer can be done by hiding/showing the text (using `v-if`), or by "flipping" the card using a CSS animation (using `:class` binding)

## Part 2

- Give the user buttons for Easy, Medium, Hard, and All which will filter the list of trivia questions on the screen depending on what they click.

## Part 3

- Give the user a Hide All button which will hide all answers that are being shown
