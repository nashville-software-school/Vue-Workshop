# Create a simple Scoreboard

For this project, create a scoreboard for two teams with `+` and `-` buttons and display the currently leading team.

[**View a Demo**](https://nss-vue-scoreboard.web.app/)

## Part 1

- Display a header saying Team 1 vs Team 2 (feel free to name these something else)
- Below the header display a score card for each team which shows the team's current score, along with `+` and `-` buttons that increments and decrements the team's score. The score should not be allowed to go below zero

## Part 2

- The name of the currently leading team in the top header should be highlighted

## Part 3

- Add a subheader below the header to say how great the lead is (e.g. "Team 1 is leading by 5 points"). If the game is tied, the subheader should say "The game is currently tied"
  - Use correct pluralization (i.e. "leading by 1 point" or "leading by 10 points")
